	"energy capacity" 150
	description "With a powerful enough generator, many ships do not need batteries at all. The one exception is projectile weapons, which usually require a burst of energy far exceeding what the generator produces. Supercapacitors provide just enough energy storage for those weapons, without requiring you to install a bulky battery pack."
	description "	This capacitor is deemed so essential that all power generation uses one in its base construction, meaning there is no standardized producer for these. Most, however, are outsourced to Syndicated Systems."

	description "This battery pack out of Syndicated Systems has more than twice the energy capacity of the most basic model, allowing your ship to engage in combat for longer periods of time before running out of energy. Some pilots have even been known to install these in lieu of any generator at all, trusting that they can reach their destination planet and recharge before running out of battery power, but that is a risky proposition."

	description "This medium-sized battery pack out of Syndicated Systems is intended for ships that need to fire the occasional salvo of high-powered weaponry without running out of energy.

	description "This is a relatively large fuel cell by Syndicated Systems. Other generators are available that produce more energy and fit into a smaller space, but they are much more expensive. As a result, large civilian ships that will not be frequently in combat often come equipped with these fuel cells."

	description "Deep Sky's nucleovoltaic generators are a relatively recent technology that harvest energy from the decay of a radioisotope source and converts it directly into electricity. They are the most powerful generator that relies on nuclear decay instead of an active nuclear chain reaction."

	description "A breeder reactor is a more efficient fission reactor that captures some of the neutron radiation produced by the reactor and uses it to enrich more fuel. They are also, of course, bigger and more expensive as a result."

	description "The Lovelace Armageddon Core was designed to meet the extreme power needs of the largest warships of the Republic Navy. One of these generators costs more than an entire fleet of smaller ships."
	description `	A local representative informs you that the name comes from the inventor, Arma G. Eddon, and has nothing to do with the core destroying a planet if broken. "That never happened, and it won't happen again, if it ever did happen." They ask you to refrain from sending letters to change the name.`

	description "The Stack Core was created by Delta V in collaboration with Kraz Cybernetics and Southbound shipyards primarily as a power source for their Dreadnoughts. It is a fission reactor, and therefore less efficient than the Navy's fusion technology, but it is also significantly cheaper to produce."
	description `	"Remember, the only way to have a 'stacked' ship is with a Stack Core!"`

	description "The Heavy Lovelace Anti-Missile turret has a longer range, higher power, and shorter reload time than its smaller sibling. The only way to overcome it is by firing missiles in a cluster so that while one is being targeted, the others can slip through. As a result all missile systems on the market default to firing in clusters if multiple copies of the same launcher are installed. This works better than staggering their fire as ordinary guns do."

One result of that isolation is that their weapons technology mostly uses beam weapons, instead of the energy projectile weapons that are more common elsewhere."
	description "	The Deep Sky Beam Laser was developed before the advent of energy shielding, but is now most useful as a mining laser. It is worth noting that while cockpits are designed to shield the pilot from laser emissions, it is still considered rude to try and point the laser in the enemy's eye."

	description "Although not the most accurate or destructive of weapons, the Energy Blaster is popular because it is small enough to be installed on even the tiniest of ships. One blaster is not enough to do appreciable damage to anything larger than a fighter, but a ship equipped with several of them becomes a force to be reckoned with."

Sophisticated software algorithms allow the turret to correct for a target's motion, making the Blaster Turret effective even against small, quickly moving fighters. Because it needs a special mounting point with a 360 degree field of view, not all ships are capable of being equipped with a turret."

	description "The Ranger Missile is designed by Lovelace Labs, which is ironically also the designer of the Anti-Missile Turret. Rumors say that the two engineering teams at Lovelace who make the missiles and the anti-missiles are locked in furious competition with each other: the result has been generation after generation of smarter missiles and then smarter turrets to fend them off."
	description "	Although not as powerful or cheap as the popular Meteor missiles, Rangers have several advantages, including their superior maneuverability, better tracking systems, and protective casings that make them much harder for anti-missile systems to destroy."

While capable of a high fire rate, this gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`

Although you can install more than one ramscoop, additional ramscoops on a single ship are not as effective as the first."

When it comes time to travel between the stars it sets off a nuclear fusion reaction powerful enough to level an entire city, and then somehow tucks the resulting explosion in between the folds of regular space-time like a wasp stinging an oak leaf to lay her eggs inside.
