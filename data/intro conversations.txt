	`	The character you make is completely your own. Everything from their name, preferences, and identity is determined by your own imagination. However, in order to give you an interface with the universe, we do have some canonical backstories.`
	`	The first and easiest choice is the Trust Fund Baby. This character grew up on a wealthy planet and only moved to New Boston to get their pilot's license. They are currently waiting on their trust to pay up, but they won't have to wait long.`
	`	The second is the normal start for Endless Sky. The Textile worker who grew up on New Boston and has been dreaming of being a space pilot since childhood. They finally saved up enough for a down payment on a loan while studying for their pilot's license. Nothing special will happen to them unless they make it happen.`
	`	The final and most difficult is the Reformed Pirate. A former outlaw rehabilitated by the Republic and granted a merchant pilot's license, you barely qualify for a loan to purchase your new ship. However, you have made dangerous enemies in the past, and must be prepared to outrun them. You had better pick a fast ship!`

	`	All the main storylines will be found in the 'Spaceport' on various planets, but many have a random chance to offer. However, not all 'Spaceport' missions will be part of a larger story chain, and some spaceport missions may have negative impacts on your finances or reputation.`

	`	Combat in Endless Sky is rather straight forward, but does include some advanced tactics if you are willing to explore the capabilities of your ships and outfits. Finding ways to ignore enemy shields, overheat their vessels, or drain their batteries can prove even more effective than buying the biggest ship you can and slugging it out. Most secondary weapons, such as missiles, can help you outrange and outrun your enemy, too!`
	`	The main default keys you will use in combat are your arrow keys to move, (Tab) to fire your primary weapon, (W) to select your secondary weapon, and (Q) to fire your secondary weapon.`

	`	Job Board will take you to a screen where you can select various types of work.`
	`	Bank will allow you to pay off any fines or loans you have, assuming you can afford to. You can also request a new loan here, if your credit rating is good enough.`
	`	Spaceport is your main go-to for story content. This is where you will find a lot of good work, story missions, mini arcs, and other surprises. Clicking this will also bring up your news pannel.`
	`	Shipyard will allow you to buy and sell ships.`
	`	Outfitter will allow you to buy, sell, and equip outfits.`
	`	Hire Crew will allow you to take on additional crew to board and capture hostile ships. You can only fit as many as you have bunks for, however.`

	`	Mouseover any stat listed in the shipyard in order to see a tooltip, which will brief you on what those numbers mean.`
	`	In the Outfitter, you will be able to view different equipment for your ship. Each piece of equipment requires a different amount of resources, however, so you will have to manage your outfit, engine, and weapons space accordingly. For this reason, the same view provided in the shipyard is availible on the right hand side of the screen. This will update your ship's stats in real time with any changes you make.`

	`	Under the long range scanner is your current target. If you have tactical scanners equipped, this may also provide information on the condition of hostile ships.`
	`	The lower left hand corner of your screen shows your fleet (if any) as well as their status, beside that will be your incomming hails and transaction history.`
	`	The upper right is your current flagship's status. Where you are, what the date is, how many credits are in your account. Beneath that is your shields condition (blue circle) and hull condition (orange circle).`

The air smells like ozone and hot metal, and your cameras are showing a plume of steam or smoke escaping from the hull near the engines. If your systems are running this hot while still in the atmosphere, they're likely to overheat the moment you hit hard vacuum. You are going to have to either install cooling systems, or trade out some components for lower-heat alternatives.`
