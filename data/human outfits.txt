	"energy capacity" 150
	description "With a powerful enough generator, many ships do not need batteries at all. The one exception is projectile weapons, which usually require a burst of energy far exceeding what the generator produces. Supercapacitors provide just enough energy storage for those weapons, without requiring you to install a bulky battery pack."

	"energy capacity" 1000
	description "A ship can run without batteries if its generator's instantaneous power output is higher than the total energy consumption of its systems, but batteries make it possible to store up energy when it is not needed and thus to use a much smaller and cheaper generator."

	description "This battery pack has more than twice the energy capacity of the most basic model, allowing your ship to engage in combat for longer periods of time before running out of energy. Some pilots have even been known to install these in lieu of any generator at all, trusting that they can reach their destination planet and recharge before running out of battery power, but that is a risky proposition."

	"energy capacity" 4800
	description "This medium-sized battery pack is intended for ships that need to fire the occasional salvo of high-powered weaponry without running out of energy. As with all battery packs, relying on batteries is risky if combat lasts long enough for them to become depleted."

	"energy capacity" 23000
	description "For most ships that require this much power, a larger generator makes more sense than a battery this size. However, battery packs have the advantage that they generate no heat, so some captains use them instead of powerful generators if they do not expect to be in combat frequently or for extended periods of time."

	description "Nucleovoltaic generators are a relatively recent generator technology that harvests energy from the decay of a radioisotope source and converts it directly into electricity. They are the most powerful generator that relies on nuclear decay instead of an active nuclear chain reaction."

	description "A breeder reactor is a more efficient fission reactor that captures some of the neutron radiation produced by the reactor and uses it to enrich more fuel. They are also, of course, bigger and more expensive as a result."

	description "Centuries ago, space battles were fought mostly with missiles, with the outcome dependent only on which ship had more shielding or ammunition.

	description "The Heavy Anti-Missile turret has a longer range, higher power, and shorter reload time than its smaller sibling. The only way to overcome it is by firing missiles in a cluster so that while one is being targeted, the others can get through, and as a result all missile systems on the market now default to firing in clusters if multiple copies of the same launcher are installed, rather than staggering their fire as ordinary guns do."

While capable of a high fire rate, this gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`

	description "A shield regenerator works by subtly modifying the geometry of your shield matrix in order to make your shields more malleable and therefore much easier to recharge.

Although you can install more than one ramscoop, additional ramscoops on a single ship are not as effective as the first."
