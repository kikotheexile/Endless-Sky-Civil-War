	description `After introducing the "Type F" cargo pod for the Hauler, it became apparent to merchant captains that the new carriers could offer more flexibility within their fleet, if there were a cargo box they could attach to the fighter arms. Enter the "F6-C: Boxwing", the Fighter that doesn't fight, but carries cargo instead. Cargo preservation equipment gives the Boxwing much more mass and very poor heat dissipation characteristics compared to other fighters. That it cannot carry any weapons is only part of the reason jocks call it "Flying Coffin" amongst themselves; besides the ship resembling one and being very sluggish, the pilot "seat" doubles as a bunk, and is cramped beyond the comfort level of most. The interactive panoramic window H.U.D. is the only thing that keeps claustrophobic episodes from becoming a major problem.`

	description "Although Betelgeuse Shipyards produces other ship models as well, the majority of their profits come from sales of the Shuttle. This versatile ship serves well as an additional passenger transport or a cargo courier."
	description `	Shuttles are not designed to withstand combat of any sort, but they are fast and maneuverable enough to get out of harm's way if attacked by a larger, slower ship. Although they are typically unarmed, they have enough space for one weapon, which is the origin of the popular phrase, "as useless as a blaster cannon on a shuttlecraft."`

	description `Southbound Shipyards quickly answered the Free Worlds' call for a carrier by building modified cargo containers for Haulers - adding a pair of Fighter docking arms, some additional outfit space, and even a couple of bunks. Access to the fighters from within the ship is so inconvenient that most pilots opt to just stay aboard their fighters when in flight. While the technical name for this ship is "Hauler I: Type F", Southbound assembly workers started calling the single container variant the "Nest" due to its complement of Finch Fighters, and the name stuck.`

It is also, however, an incredibly slow ship and difficult to maneuver, especially when loaded down with cargo. Some freight caravans use ordinary freighters instead of bulk freighters just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Bulk Freighter to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."

	description "The Megaparsec Quicksilver is a warship built around a single concept: to design the smallest and fastest ship capable of carrying two particle cannons. Because of its speed and long weapons range, the Quicksilver can keep a safe distance from most targets and bombard them with particle bursts until they are destroyed."
	description "When the Quicksilver finds it too far out of range of its intended target, it can always engage its cloak for a short time to close the distance."

	description "Named for the Goddess of rain, misery, shadow and sorrow, this Republic missile boat comes equipped with four missile launchers and enough ammunition to destroy even ships many times its size. Because of their lack of maneuverability and relatively light shielding, Achlys serve best as long-range attack ships, and once their missile supply is spent, they are relatively useless in combat."

	description "The Lionheart Raven is their most popular warship, an agile and elegant vessel that can nevertheless deal out and absorb considerable damage. Ravens are a favorite ship for bounty hunters, because they are more than a match for pirate Gunships and can be used by a skilled pilot to take down much larger ships as well."
	description "The Raven is capable of using its tactical cloak to get itself out of, or into, trouble."

	description "After decades of capturing and ransoming Star Queens, the shipyards on Haven came into an overabundance of otherwise useless transports. Initial attempts to rent these out as stationary luxury apartments fell flat, so it was decided to convert these into combat vessels. Unsurprisingly, its sold with the same outfits it had when captured."
	description "	Once stripped of its luxury resources, the Star Queen proved a surprisingly sturdy and nimble hull. Although lightly armed even by frigate standards, the Endevors engine space and shield strength can almost rival a cruisers, landing it squarely in the Destroyer range."

	description "The Betelgeuse Shipyards Firebird is a warship with a long and storied past; Firebirds fought on both sides of the Alpha Wars over half a millennium ago, and although the equipment and systems have been upgraded continuously since then, the basic design remains almost the same. The Firebird is also a very rugged ship and easy to repair; supposedly a few of the Firebirds that fought in those wars are still in service today."

	description "Named for an ancient diety of speed and riding the line between frigate and destroyer, this cutting edge vessel mixes the drone capacity of an Aletheia with the speed of a considerably smaller ship. This speed comes at the cost of hull and shield strength. Unlike other Navy designs, the Zephyrus functions best in a Cutter or Scout role and should only be used in combat roles in a pinch, and is the largest ship currently capable of cloaking."

	description `Voted the "ugliest ship in the sky" by Stars and Starships Magazine, the Protector is a typical example of brutally efficient Syndicate engineering. It is basically nothing more than six turrets attached to a set of engines and crew's quarters, designed as a defense platform that can accompany merchant convoys.`

	description `The Protector was a commercial flop, too slow to properly protect a convoy, and too weak to protect itself. The Syndicate has since begun retrofitting their massive, slow vessels to instead serve as carriers for their hit Barb and Thorn fighters.`
	description `	By trimming down the turret ports and converting the extra power to engines, the Aegis is considerably faster than its base ship, and can carry as many fighters as Southbound's Skein.`

	description `The Vanguard is Syndicated Systems' newest warship intended for the heavy anti-pirate defense market. Vanguards offer an unusual feature set, focusing on powerful fixed guns and featuring Syndicated Systems' latest automation technologies, resulting in an atypically low crew complement for a ship its size. Few capital ships will endure for long under the withering fusillade of gunfire that it can unleash against those in front of it.`

It is not only a freighter, but a carrier, and a capable warship either at short range or at a distance."
	description "	Naturally, this versatility also makes it extremely expensive, and the Bactrian is normally only for sale to citizens who have been vetted by the local government of the Deep."

	description "This Arrow has had numerous modifications to its hull and internal systems to make more room for outfits - mostly with combat in mind. More shields, weapons, engines, outfit space, and a turret mount nearly push this ship into classification as a frigate, and definitely make it one of the heaviest gunships you're likely to find."

	description `After the Syndicate released their Vanguard cruiser, the Manta fell somewhat out of favor due to its lack of ability to mount any anti-missile turrets. This Manta rectified that, added some extra armor plating and shield emitters, and rearranged some of the internals to yield a little more outfit space. Dry tonnage alone keeps it from being classified as a cruiser.`

	description `A previous owner of this Manta has gone to great lengths to make sure they could bring all six gun ports to bear in a hurry, and chase down smaller warships. Style was not lost on that captain, and a forked tail yielded a little more space for shield projectors in an area that would have been destabilized by engine exhaust. If its dry tonnage were any higher, it would be classified as a cruiser.`

	description "A rare sight in human space, the Quarg's famed Wardragon is capable of taking on entire fleets of Human ships single handedly. Because of this, the Quarg are required to get permission from the Republic before sending one of these vessels anywhere in human space."
	description "	Many conspiracy theorists wonder why the Quarg would abide by such regulations and laws if they are so powerful."
